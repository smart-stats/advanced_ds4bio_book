## Introduction

The term "Data science" is typically used to refer to a set of tools, techniques and thought processes used to perform scientific inquiries using data. But is that a scientific topic worthy of study in its own right? It is. And, from a practical, theoretical and philosophical level, it's already extremely well studied in statistics, computer science, engineering and philosophy departments. 

Despite these fields, at the Data Science Lab at JHU, we've had lengthy discussions about data science as an inductive, empirical applied science, like biology or medicine, rather than an deductive discipline, like mathematics or statistical theory, or rather than a set of heuristics, like rules of thumb and agreed upon best practices. An inductive, empirical, applied science itself needs data science, since it's empirical and thus depends on data. So, maybe there's an infinite regress of some sort making this an ultimately doomed endeavor. But, nevertheless, we persist. 

There are some fields of data analysis that are well covered, let's talk about them first.

### Graphics, visualization and EDA

General EDA and visualization is covered in the next chapter. There is a vast literature of experiments to understand perception of visual data. This is a more neatly circumscribed area of data science as a science. This is possibly because the general field of visual perception, from a variety of angles, is well developed. Let's cover a specific example, observer studies in radiology.

#### Observer studies
In diagnostic radiology, new technology in the form of new machines for imaging or new ways of processing images, are being invented constantly. To evaluate these new technologies, a gold standard is to have randomized studies where the underlying truth is known. The images from the new technology and images from a control technology are then randomized to observers. Several issues come about in observer studies. First, establishing truth can be hard. This is often done by digital or physical phantoms or in instances where patients are longitudinally followed up and the disease status is made apparent. A second issue is in the cost associated with observers. Often, instead of attending radiologists, the studies are done with residents or fellows, or students who have received specific training to qualify as reasonable proxies. An interesting alternative approach is to have digital observers.
